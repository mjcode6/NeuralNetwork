Neural Network Development & Architecture Guide
Developing a Neural Network involves understanding its architecture, training process, and implementation. Below is a step-by-step guide to neural network development, from basic concepts to implementation.

1. Neural Network Architecture
A neural network consists of neurons (nodes) arranged in layers. The key layers are:

1.1. Layers in Neural Networks
Input Layer 🟢

Receives raw data (e.g., images, text, or numerical values).
Number of neurons = Number of input features.
Hidden Layers 🔵

Intermediate processing layers that learn patterns.
Each layer applies weights, biases, and activation functions.
More layers → More complexity (Deep Learning).
Output Layer 🔴

Produces final predictions (e.g., classification labels or numerical values).
The number of neurons matches the required outputs (e.g., 10 for digit recognition).
2. Building a Neural Network (Step-by-Step)
Step 1: Choose the Type of Neural Network
Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) – Basic NN with forward data flow.
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) – For image processing.
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – For sequential data (text, time series).
Transformers – Advanced models like GPT for NLP tasks.
Step 2: Define Network Parameters
Number of layers – More layers improve feature extraction.
Number of neurons per layer – More neurons increase model capacity.
Activation functions – Define non-linearity (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh).
Weight initialization – Helps avoid vanishing/exploding gradients.
Step 3: Implement Forward Propagation
Each neuron performs:

Output

𝑡

𝑣
𝑎
𝑡

𝑜
𝑛
(
(
𝑊
×
𝑋
)
+
𝐵
)
Output=Activation((W×X)+B)
where:

𝑊
W = Weights
𝑋
X = Input
𝐵
B = Bias
Activation function introduces non-linearity.
Common activation functions:

ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) → 
𝑓

𝑥

(

f(x)=max(0,x) (Good for deep networks).
Sigmoid →

f(x)=

  (Centered around 0).
Step 4: Compute Loss Function
Loss function measures the difference between actual and predicted outputs.
For classification:
Cross-entropy loss:
𝐿
=
−
∑
𝑦
log
⁡
(
𝑦
^
)
L=−∑ylog( 
y

​
 )
For regression:
Mean Squared Error (MSE):
𝐿
=

𝑁
∑

)

L= 
N

 ∑(y− 
y

 )

Step 5: Backpropagation (Weight Update)
Compute gradient of the loss function w.r.t. each weight.

Update weights using Gradient Descent:

𝑊
new
=
𝑊
−
𝛼
×
∇
𝐿
W 
new
​
 =W−α×∇L
where:

𝛼
α = Learning rate
∇
𝐿
∇L = Gradient of loss
Optimizers (to improve training speed):

SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)
Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)
RMSprop
Step 6: Training the Neural Network
Initialize weights & biases (random or He/Xavier initialization).
Loop through training data multiple times (epochs).
Perform forward pass to compute predictions.
Compute loss between predicted and actual values.
Apply backpropagation to adjust weights.
Repeat until convergence (loss stops decreasing).
Step 7: Evaluating and Testing the Model
Accuracy (Classification): Compare predicted vs actual labels.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) (Regression): Measures absolute difference.
Precision/Recall/F1-score: For imbalanced datasets.
